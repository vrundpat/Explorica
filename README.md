# Wander
A 3D exploration game built using Java &amp; OpenGL with a custom engine.

An exploration game where you can run around, interact with objects and move around entities! It's quite a simple game with not a large emphasis on gameplay, but rather for the underlying Game Engine involved. The custom game engine was written in Java, LWJGL 2.9 & GLSL which drives the shader code. Along with the game engine, there is an additional array of tools such as an ```OBJ File Decoder``` which was used within the Game Engine itself.

### Running Wander
In terms of running Wander locally, ```LWJGL 2.9``` is needed (platform-independent), along with the suitable JARS and Utils which are platform dependent. The Utils and JARS in this repo are meant for the use of Mac based machines, specifically Mac OS 10+. You would have to find the correct JARS and Utils for your platform specifically and link them to the project. Presently, ```Mac OS 10+``` users can run Wander out of the box, but other platforms will have to fill in these gaps accordingly.
